# What tests?

Here you describe the unit tests you run for the project.
	
## What tests do
	-- We can test by removing the input file "loomings.txt" in the "data" folder
		The program should terminate.

	-- We can replace the file back into the "data" folder and check output
		This time program should run fine.

	-- Increase the duplicate line in the file "loomings.txt"
		It should display all the duplicate files on the screen.
		Also, the diff command will show more differences in the file.

	-- Remove all the duplicate line in the file "loomings.txt".
		This time it would not print anything on the screen for the duplicate scenario.
		In this case the diff command will not show any difference as two files would be same.
