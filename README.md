# What this project contains

At top level, this README.md file.
And there should be a `run.sh` file which can be run without any arguments from a shell to provide all necessary input and produce clear output that demonstrate that the project does what it claims to do.

## Source code 

Under `sources` directory. 
All the source files are placed "Rdcrtfile.cpp", "read_create_file.cpp", "Utilityfunc.cpp".

## Data

Under `data` directory.
The looming.txt is placed. This file will be read by the code and the output file "loomings-clean.txt" is also placed here.
This would help to compare two files easily.

## Documentation

Under `documentation` directory. 
Describe the project, what it does, how it works, how to build and run the project, what are the tests
that have been run in what way, how it is designed and what bugs and limitations exist for the future enhancements, and any additional comments.
